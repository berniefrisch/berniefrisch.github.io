# About

My name is Bernie Frisch. I'm a cartoonist and character designer (and creator of Kairos Bijou).

I'm Jewish, trans, white, and autistic.

My motivation for being an internet comics creator is deciding my own schedule and having the freedom to do whatever the hell I want and not having to listen to publishers that deem works not fit for viewer consumption.

My biggest inspirations are Bryan Lee O'Malley (of *Scott Pilgrim* fame), Akira Toriyama (of *Dragon Ball* fame), and Aaron McGruder (of *The Boondocks* fame).

That's all I gotta say about myself, really.
